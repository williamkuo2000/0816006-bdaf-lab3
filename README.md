# Bank Smart Contract
Smart contract for people do deposite or to withdraw self-define token.

## Environment setup
For details, follow the steps on https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/hello-world-smart-contract .

First, initialize your project in your project folder.
```
npm init
```
Answer a few question for the package.json file.

Second, download hardhat and create a hardhat project.
```
npm install --save-dev hardhat
npx hardhat
```
```

üë∑ Welcome to Hardhat v2.12.2 üë∑‚Äç

? What do you want to do? ‚Ä¶ 
  Create a JavaScript project
  Create a TypeScript project
‚ùØ  Create an empty hardhat.config.js
  Quit
```

Add project folders.
```
mkdir contracts
mkdir scripts
```
Here you may add the two solidity files (`bank.sol`, `my_token.sol`) into the contracts file into your onw contracts file, and add `deploy.js` into the scripts file.
```
contracts
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄbank.sol
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄmy_token.sol
scripts
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄdeploy.js
```

Next you'll have to create and configure the `.env` file.

First, install the dotenv package in your project directory:
```
npm install dotenv --save
```

Inside your `.env` should be like this.

```
API_URL = "YOUR_API_URL"
PRIVATE_KEY = "YOU_PRIVATE_KEY"
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY = "YOUR_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY"
```


Next install `ethers.js` and etherscan plugin.
```
npm install --save-dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers "ethers@^5.0.0"
npm install --save-dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan
```

We're at the final few steps, here you'll have to update your `hardhat.config.js` to look like this.

```
require('dotenv').config();
require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers");
require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan");

const { API_URL, PRIVATE_KEY } = process.env;
const ETHERSCAN_API_KEY = process.env.ETHERSCAN_API_KEY;

module.exports = {
   solidity: "0.8.0",
   defaultNetwork: "goerli",
   networks: {
      hardhat: {},
      goerli: {
         url: API_URL,
         accounts: [`0x${PRIVATE_KEY}`]
      }
   },
   etherscan: {
      // Your API key for Etherscan
      // Obtain one at https://etherscan.io/
      apiKey: ETHERSCAN_API_KEY
    }
}
```

We're done with the environment.

## Contract deployment

First compile the contract:
```
pnx hardhat compile
```
Deploy it on the goerli testnet.
```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli 
```

If every thing went smoothly, it should say:
```
‚ûú  Lab3 npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
My_Token deployed to: 0x38F1Fa207318787676E99470193398D002889548
Bank deployed to: 0xB25C30cEF1d0D46B54d6c3DD29c83c3230F0414C
```

## Verification
To do verification with hardhat, do:
```
npx hardhat verify --network goerli "YourTokenDeployedAddress" --contract 'contracts/my_token.sol:my_token'
npx hardhat verify --network goerli "YourBankDeployedAddress" --contract "contracts/bank.sol:bank" "YourTokenDeployedAddress"
```

Now your smart contract should displayed correctly on the etherscan.
For details on this part, checkout https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/submitting-your-smart-contract-to-etherscan .

## Appoval

You'll have to first go to the `my_token` contract to approve the usage of the self-define "MTK" for `amount` of tokens for `bank` contract. Paste the address of the contract `bank` into `spender(address)`.

Now you'll be able to play with the tokens that are being approved.
